# Contributing Guideline

Here's how to submit a Pull Request (PR):

1. [Fork this repository on GitHub][fork] then do the following:
    * Setup an [Upstream remote][configure-upstream] to this repository
      `https://github.com/kobulwidodo/bcc-masterclass.git`.
    * [Sync your fork][sync-fork] with the upstream.
2. Clone your fork of the repository to your local computer.
3. Create a branch with a descriptive name to work (i.e., `git checkout -b your-name`).
4. Make changes, commit them, and push the branch to your repository fork.
5. [Submit a pull request][pull-req] to the master branch.
6. Please leave us your LINE contact, full name, and NIM on the pull request, and we will contact you for further information. Please take note if you're planning to use a pseudonymous GitHub account, as your real identity would have to be included in the pull request.
